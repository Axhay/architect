## RedShift

1. Data Warehouse.
2. Does not scale automatically.
3. Partly resides in S3.
4. Run complex, analytic queries against petabytes of stuctured data.
5. Structured and unstructured.
6. SQL Queries
7. Petabyte Scale.
8. Enable data encryption for your clusters to protect data at rest.
9. Data Archival aggregated over last 12 months.
10. Resilient data warehouse solution.
11. Encrypt all data in the Redshift cluster at Rest using AWS KMS Default Customer master key.
12. Encrypt all the data in Redshift cluster.
  - Encrypt data at rest?
     - **Use AWS KMS Default customer master key.**
13. **Redshift spectrum**:
  - Run queries directly against Exabytes of structured and unstructured data in S3 without need for unnecessary data movement.

## More:

1. Redshift configured as :
- Single node (160GB)
- Multi-node
    Leader Node (manage client connections and receives queries)
    Compute Node (store data and perform queries and computations) up to 128 compute nodes.
2. Advanced compression
- Columnar data stores can be compressed much more than row based data stores as similar data is stored sequentially.
- Multiple compression techniques and can often achieve significant compression relative to traditional relational data stores.
3. Does not require indexes or materialized views and so uses less space than traditional database systems.
4. When loading data into empty table, redshift automatically smaples your data and selects more appropriate compressions scheme.

## MPP(Massively parallel processing)

1. Automatically distributes data and query load across all nodes.
2. It makes it easy to add nodes to your data warehouse and enables you to maintain fast query performance as your data warehouse grows.
3. Redshift backups:
- Enabled by default with 1 day retention period.
- Max retention period of 35 days.
- Maintain at least 3 copies of your data(original, replica in compute nodes, backup in S3)
4. Redshift camn also asynchronously replicate your snapshots to S3 in another region for disaster recovery.

## Pricing:

1. Compute node hours (billed for 1 unit per node per hour)
2. You will not charged for leader node hours only compute node.
3. Backup.
4. Data transfer only within VPC, not outside it.

## Security considerations:

1. Encrypted in transing using SSL.
2. Encrypted at rest using AES-256 replication.
3. By default redshift takes care of key management.
    Manage own keys using HSM
    AWS Key management service.

## Availability:

1. Only available in 1 AZ currently.
2. Can restore snapshots to new AZs in the event of an outage.

## Tips:

1. Used for BI
2. Available in only 1 AZ.
3. Backups:
 - Enabled by default with 1 day retention period.
 - Max retention period is 35 days.
4. Redshift always attempts to maintain 3 copies of data.
5. Can asynchronously replicate snapshots to S3 in another region for disaster recovery.
