## Amazon Aurora

Scenes:

1. Bank is writing new software dependant on DB transcations for write consistency.
   - App will do joins across multiple tables.
   - DB must automatically scale as the amount of data grows.
   - AWS service to run the database.
     - **Amazon Aurora.**

2. Design Disaster recovery (DR) in separate AWS region from applications primary workload.
   - Multi tier architecture and only RDS instance have frequent changes.
   - App installation takes 60 mins on average.
   - DR have an RPO of less than 90 mins and RTO of less than 30 mins. 
   - To meet these:
     - **An Aurora instance as primary database with read replica in DR region.**
     - **A cross region EC2 AMI copy.**

3. App stores data in RDS MySQL DB instance.
   - DB queries consists of read queries, which are overwhelming current database.
   - SA wants to scale the database.
   - What combination of steps to achieve goal?
     - **Migrate MySQL database to Aurora.**
     - **Create read replicas in different AZ.**

4. Team launching marketing campaign and the peak database read activity in Aurora for MySQL is expected to increase.
   - SA decides to add two Read replicas to the cluster.
   - How should SA ensure that connections for read activities are load balanced?
      - **Reader endpoint for amazon Aurora.**

5. SA is creating new relational DB.
   - Compliance team will use DB, and mandates that data content must be stored across three different AZ.
   - Which option to use?
      - **Aurora.**

6. Company wants to migrate a highly transactional DB to AWS.
   - Requirements state that the DB has more than 6TB of data and will grow exponentially.
   - Which solution should SA recommend?
      - **Amazon Aurora.**

7. Web app stores all data in RDS Aurora DB instance.
   - SA wants to provide access to the data for detailed report for marketing team, but is concerned that additional load on the DB will affect the performance of web app.
   - How can report be created without affecting performance of application?
      - **Create a read replica of the database.**

8. Popular e-commerse app runs on AWS.
   - The app encounters performance issues.
   - DB is unable to handle amount of queries and load during peak hours.
   - The DB is running on RDS Aurora engine on the largest instance size available.
   - What should admin do to improve performance?
      - **Create one or more read replicas.**

## More:

1. MySQL compatible relational database engine that combines speed and availability of high end commercial DB with simplicity and cost effectiveness of open databases.
2. Provides up to 5 times better performance than MySQL at a price point one tenth that of commercial db while delivering similar performance and availability.
3. Start with 10GB, scales in 10GB increment up to 64TB(storage autoscaling)
4. Compute resources can scale up to 32vCPUs and 244GB of memory.
5. 2 copies of data is contained in each AZ, with min of 3AZ and 6 copies of your data.

## Scaling Aurora:

1. Handle up to 2 copies of loss of data without affecting DB write availability and up to 3 copies without affecting read availability.
2. Datablocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and repaired automatically.
3. Aurora storage is self healing.

Types of replicas are two.
1. Aurora replicas (currently 15)
2. MySQL Read Replicas (currently 5)

Exam tips:

1. 2 copies of data in each AZ, with min of 3 AZ. 6 copies of data.
2. Shared aurora snapshots with other AWS accounts.
3. Automated failover available only with Aurora replicas.
4. Aurora has automated backups turned on by default. 
5. Can also take snapshots with Aurora.

## Features:

1. Number of replicas
- Aurora: 15
- MySQL: 5
2. ReplicationType
- Aurora: Asynchronous(ms)
- MySQL: Asynchronous(sec)
3. Performance impact on primary
- Aurora: low
- MySQL: high
4. Acts as failover target
- Aurora: Yes (no data loss)
- MySQL: Yes (potentially minutes of data loss)
5. Automated failover
- Aurora: Yes
- MySQL: No
6. Support for user friendly replication delay
- Aurora: No
- MySQL: Yes
7. Support for diff data or schema vs primary
- Aurora: No
- MySQL: Yes

## Backups with Aurora:
1. Automated backups are always enabled on Aurora DB instance. Backups do not impact DB performance.
2. You can also take snapshots with Aurora. This also does not impact on performance.
3. Can share Aurora snapshots with other AWS accounts.
