## ElasticCache

1. Session data - Elasticache.
2. Enabling ElastiCache Multi-AZ with automatic failover on your Redis cluster (in the API and CLI, replication group) improves your fault tolerance. This is true particularly in cases where your cluster's read/write primary cluster becomes unreachable or fails for any reason. Multi-AZ with automatic failover is only supported on Redis clusters that support replication
3. Scheduled Instances are a good choice for workloads that do not run continuously, but do run on a regular schedule. For example, you can use Scheduled Instances for an application that runs during business hours or for batch processing that runs at the end of the week.
If you require a capacity reservation on a continuous basis, Reserved Instances might meet your needs and decrease costs.
