## RDS - Relational Database Service.

1. With RDS Storage Auto Scaling, you simply set your desired maximum storage limit, and Auto Scaling takes care of the rest.
2. You can only enable encryption for an Amazon RDS DB instance when you create it, not after the DB instance is created.
For an Amazon RDS encrypted DB instance, all logs, backups, and snapshots are encrypted.
3. DynamoDB is HA. But Postgre is'nt. So a Multi AZ is needed.
4. You can enable point-in-time recovery using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the DynamoDB API. When it's enabled, point-in-time recovery provides continuous backups until you explicitly turn it off.
DR takes things to a completely new level, wherein you need to be able to recover from a different region thatâ€™s separated by over 250 miles.
5. Think read replicas when performance is mentioned. Think Multi-AZ when high availability is mentioned
6. In a Multi AZ, AWS runs just one DB but copies the data synchronously to the standby replica
The question targets Read Contention( responsiveness ) and write is not an issue and hence the Read Replicas.
7. The application servers and database must be secure. so it must be on a private subnet. ELB already in public subnet .Elb will communicate to private subnet.

## More:

1. Runs on VMS.
2. Cannot log into these OS ever.
3. RDS is not serverless.
4. Aurora is serverless.
5. RDS is multi-AZ
6. Two different backups for RDS:
 - Automated backups
 - Database snapshots
7. Automated backups:
 - enabled by default
 - backed up data stored in S3.
 - You can free storage space equal to size of your DB
 - If you have RDS instance of 10GB, you will get 10GB worth of storage.
 - Backups taken in a defined window.
 - During backup, stoarge I/O may be suspended while data is being backed up and you may experience elevated latency.
8. Database snapshots
 - Done manually user initiated.
 - They are stored even after you delete original RDS instance, unlike automated backups.
9. Restoring backups:
 - Whenever you restore either automatic or manual snapshot, restored version of DB will be new RDS instance with a new DNS endpoint.
