## Load Balancers

1. An application load balancer can take the place of multiple individual classic load balancers to load balance microservices (e.g. running on AWS ECS) saving costs.
Most importantly though, COST. Application Load Balancers cost $0.0252 per hour. Classic Load Balancers cost $0.028 per hour. A great article is here to refer: https://medium.com/cognitoiq/how-cognitoiq-are-using-application-load-balancers-to-cut-elastic-load-balancing-cost-by-90-78d4e980624b

Scenes:

1. Organization hosts 10 microservices, each in autoscaling group behind individual CLB. Each EC2 instance running at optimal load. Which will allow organization to reduce costs without impacting performance?
    - **Replace the Classic Load Balancers with a single Application Load Balancer.**

2. SA plans to migrate load balancer tier from data center to AWS. Several websites have multiple domains that require secure load balancing. SA decides to use Elastic Load balancing application load balancers. What is most efficient method to achieve secure communication?
       - **Create an SNI certificate and upload it to the Application Load Balancer**

3. Company needs to use AWS resources to expand capacity for a website hosted in on-premises data center. AWS resources will include load balancers, auto scaling and EC2 instances that will access on premises database. Network connectivity has been established but no traffic is going to AWS environment. How should Route 53 be configured to distribute load to AWS environment?
       - **Set up a weighted routing policy, distributing the workload between the load balancer and the on-premises environment.**
       - **Set up an A record to point the DNS name to the IP address of the load balancer.**

4. SA needs to deploy HTTP/HTTPS service on EC2 instances with support for WebSockets using load balancers. How can architect meet these requirements?
      - **Configure an Application Load Balancer.**
Http/Https are application layer (osi layer 7)
