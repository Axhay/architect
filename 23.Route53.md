## Route 53

1. MultiValue Answer Routing would fit to random queries with health checks.
2. You can use the cloudfront with Route 53 Geolocation Routing. But the location wise content delivery is already enabled in cloudfront, so geolocation policy wont help that much. If you are not using cloudfront and you want to distribute traffic based on user location, then you can use Route53
3. For an active-active system, Geolocation, Geoproximity, Latency, Multivalue, or Weighted policies would work.

Scenes:

1. SA has five web servers serving requests for a domain. Which of the following Route 53 routing policies can distribute traffic randomly among all healthy web servers?
    - **Multivalue Answer**

2. SA is designing a solution for dynamic website, “example.com” that is deployed in two regions: Tokyo, Japan and Sydney, Australia. Architect wants to ensure that user located in Australia are directed to website deployed in sydney and users in Japan are redirected to website in tokyo when they browse to example.com. Which service should the architect use to achieve this goal with LEAST administrative effort?
    - **Amazon Route 53**

3. Company is designing a failover strategy in Route 53 for its resources between two AWS regions. Company must have ability to route users traffic to the region with least latency, and if both regions are healthy, Route 53 should route traffic to resources in both regions. Which strategy should SA recommend?
    - **Configure active-active failover using Route 53 latency DNS records.**

4. Company is launching a static website using zone apex(mycompany.com). The company wants to use Route 53 for DNS. Which steps should the company perform to implement scalable and cost-effective solution?
    - **Serve the website from an Amazon S3 bucket, and map a Route 53 alias record to the website endpoint.**
    - **Create a Route 53 hosted zone, and set the NS records of the domain to use Route 53 name servers.**

5. SA is designing a web app that will be hosted on EC2 instances in public subnet. The web app uses mySQL DB in private subnet. DB should be accessible to DBA. Which of the following SA should recommend?
    - **Create a bastion host in a public subnet, and use the bastion host to connect to the database.**
    - **Create an IPSec VPN tunnel between the customer site and the VPC, and use the VPN tunnel to connect to the database.**
