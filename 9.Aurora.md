## Amazon Aurora

Scenes:

1. Bank is writing new software dependant on DB transcations for write consistency.
   - App will do joins across multiple tables.
   - DB must automatically scale as the amount of data grows.
   - AWS service to run the database.
     - **Amazon Aurora.**

2. Design Disaster recovery (DR) in separate AWS region from applications primary workload.
   - Multi tier architecture and only RDS instance have frequent changes.
   - App installation takes 60 mins on average.
   - DR have an RPO of less than 90 mins and RTO of less than 30 mins. 
   - To meet these:
     - **An Aurora instance as primary database with read replica in DR region.**
     - **A cross region EC2 AMI copy.**

3. App stores data in RDS MySQL DB instance.
   - DB queries consists of read queries, which are overwhelming current database.
   - SA wants to scale the database.
   - What combination of steps to achieve goal?
     - **Migrate MySQL database to Aurora.**
     - **Create read replicas in different AZ.**

4. Team launching marketing campaign and the peak database read activity in Aurora for MySQL is expected to increase.
   - SA decides to add two Read replicas to the cluster.
   - How should SA ensure that connections for read activities are load balanced?
      - **Reader endpoint for amazon Aurora.**

5. SA is creating new relational DB.
   - Compliance team will use DB, and mandates that data content must be stored across three different AZ.
   - Which option to use?
      - **Aurora.**

6. Company wants to migrate a highly transactional DB to AWS.
   - Requirements state that the DB has more than 6TB of data and will grow exponentially.
   - Which solution should SA recommend?
      - **Amazon Aurora.**

7. Web app stores all data in RDS Aurora DB instance.
   - SA wants to provide access to the data for detailed report for marketing team, but is concerned that additional load on the DB will affect the performance of web app.
   - How can report be created without affecting performance of application?
      - **Create a read replica of the database.**

8. Popular e-commerse app runs on AWS.
   - The app encounters performance issues.
   - DB is unable to handle amount of queries and load during peak hours.
   - The DB is running on RDS Aurora engine on the largest instance size available.
   - What should admin do to improve performance?
      - **Create one or more read replicas.**
