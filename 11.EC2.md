## EC2 Instance and Instance Types

1. "multicontainer-based" => EC2, path-base routing: ALB
2. Default Termination Policy
This section describes the default termination policy used by an Auto Scaling group when a scale-in event occurs. The default termination policy is designed to help ensure that your instances span Availability Zones evenly for high availability. The default policy is kept generic and flexible to cover a range of scenarios.
With the default termination policy, the behavior of the Auto Scaling group is as follows:
1) Determine which Availability Zone(s) have the most instances, and at least one instance that is not protected from scale in.
If there are multiple unprotected instances to choose from in the Availability Zone(s) with the most instances, an instance is selected for termination based on the following criteria (applied in the order shown).
3. Scaling based on a schedule enables you to scale your application in response to predictable changes in demand. To use scheduled scaling, you create scheduled actions, which tell Spot Fleet to perform scaling activities at specific times. When you create a scheduled action, you specify the Spot Fleet, when the scaling activity should occur, minimum capacity, and maximum capacity. You can create scheduled actions that scale one time only or that scale on a recurring schedule.
4. Sec groups are stateful and only accept Allow rules.
5. Security Group: Traffic can be restricted by any IP protocol, by service port, and source/destination IP address (individual IP or CIDR block).
6. Predictive Scaling, a feature of AWS Auto Scaling uses machine learning to schedule the right number of EC2 instances in anticipation of approaching traffic changes. Predictive Scaling predicts future traffic, including regularly-occurring spikes, and provisions the right number of EC2 instances in advance.

Scenes:

1. Team has developed a new web application in AWS region that has three availability zones: AZ-a, AZ-b and AZ-c. Application need to be fault tolerant and needs at least six EC2 instances running at all times. Application must tolerate loss of connectivity to any AZ so that application can continue to run.
       - **AZ-a with six EC2 instances, AZ-b with six EC2 instances, and AZ-c with no EC2 instances.**
       - **AZ-a with three EC2 instances, AZ-b with three EC2 instances, and AZ-c with three EC2 instances.**

2. Design multi-container based web application. Part of the web application, /order and /sale-event must scale independently while maintianing single fully qualified domain name. Which AWS service will help architect build this platform?
       - **Amazon ELB Application Load Balancer**
       - **Amazon EC2 Container Service**

3. Environment has auto scaling group across two AZ referred to as AZ-a and AZ-b and default termination policy. AZ-a has four Amazon EC2 instances and AZ-b has three EC2 instances. No instance is protected from scale in. How will Auto Scaling proceed if there is a scale-in event?
       - **Auto Scaling selects the Availability Zone with four EC2 instances and then continues to evaluate.**

4. Company’s new web application running on EC2 across multiple AZ will be heavily accessed during regular business hours. After business hours, usage will be minimal. What fleet-scaling approach should be used to size the EC2 fleet to handle traffic demands?
       - **Scheduled scaling**

5. SA is designing an application that requires having six amazon EC2 instances running at all times. Application will be deployed in the sa-east-1 region which has three AZ. Which action will provide 100% fault tolerance and lowest cost in even that one AZ in region becomes unavailable?
       - **Deploy three Amazon EC2 instances in sa-east-1a, three Amazon EC2 instances in sa-east-1b, and three Amazon EC2 instances in sa-east-1c**

if one AZ goes down, 6 instances are still running

6. Company is launching dynamic website and the Operations team expects up to 10 times the traffic on launch date. Website is hosted on EC2 instances and traffic is distributed by Amazon Route 53. SA must ensure that there is enough backend capacity to meet users demand. The operation team wants to scale down as quick as possible after launch. What is the most cost effective and fault tolerant solution that will meet company's needs?
       - **Set up an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to multiple EC2 instances**
       - **Set up an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones for the website, and create scale-out and scale-in policies**

7. SA is designing new architecture that will use EC2 Auto Scaling group. Which of the following factors determine the health check grace period?
       - **How much of the application code is embedded in the AMI.**
       - **How long the bootstrap script takes to run.**

8. How can a user track memory usage in EC2 instance?
       - **Place an agent on the EC2 instance to push memory usage to an Amazon CloudWatch custom metric.**
       Cloudwatch + Memory = Agent + Custom Metric

9. Company running series of national TV campaigns. These 30-second ad will introduce sudden traffic peaks targeted at Node.js application. Company expects traffic to increase from five requests each minute to more than 5,000 requests each minute. Which AWS service SA uses to ensure traffic surges can be handled?
       - **An Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances**

10. Customer setup VPC with one private subnet and one public subnet with NAT gateway. VPC will contain a group of EC2 instances. All instances configure themselves at startup by downloading bootstrap script from S3 bucket with policy that allows access from customers Amazon EC2 instances and then deploys application through GIT.  SA is tasked with solution that provides highest level of security regarding network connectivity to EC2 instances. How can SA design infrastructure?
    - **Place the Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet, with no EIPs; route outgoing traffic through the NAT gateway**
    EC2 instances running in private subnets of a VPC can now have controlled access to S3 buckets, objects, and API functions that are in the same region as the VPC.

11. Data processing application runs on i3.large EC2 instance with single 100GB EBS gp2 volume. App stores temporary data in small database (less than 30 GB) located on EBS root volume. App is struggling to process data fast enough, and SA has determined that the I/O speed of temporary database is the bottleneck. What is the most cost-efficient way to improve DB response times?
       - **Move the temporary database onto instance storage.**

12. Web server will be provisioned on two EC2 instances with an ALB. Which config will allow traffic on HTTP and HTTPS when configuring security group to apply to each of these servers?
    - **Allow incoming traffic to HTTP and HTTPS ports.**

13. A company requires OS permission on a relational database server. What should a SA suggest as a configuration for highly scalable database architecture?
       - **Multiple EC2 instances in a database replication configuration that uses two Availability Zones.**

14. SA is concerned that the current security group rules for a DB tier are too permissive and may permit requests that should be restricted. Below are current security group permissions for the DB tier. Protocol: TCP, Port range: 1433 (MS SQL), Source: ALL. Currently, the only identified resource that needs to connect to the DB is the application tier consisting of an auto scaling group of EC2 instances. What changes can be made to this security group that would offer the users LEAST privilege?
       - **Change the source to the security group ID attached to the application instances.**

15. Company has a website running on EC2. The application DNS name points to an Elastic IP address associated with the EC2 instance. In the event of an attack on the website coming from a specific IP address, the company wants a way to block offending IP addresses. Which tool or service should SA recommend to block IP address?
       - **Network ACL**

16. Company wants to migrate a three-tier web app to AWS. Company wants to control the placement of the instances and have visibility into underlying sockets and cores for licensing purposes. Which compute model should a SA choose to accomplish this task?
       - **EC2 Dedicated Hosts**

17. SA is designing a service that must have 4 EC2 instances running between 8am and 6pm daily. Service requires one EC2 instance outside of those hours. What is the most cost effective way to provide enough compute?
    - **Use one Amazon EC2 Reserved Instance and use an Auto Scaling Group scheduled action to add three EC2 On-Demand instances at 7:30 AM and remove three instances at 6:10 PM.**

18. App is running on EC2 instances behind an ALB. The instances run in an Auto Scaling group across multiple AZ. Four instances are required to handle predictable traffic load. SA wants to ensure that the operation is fault tolerant up to the loss of one AZ. Which is the most cost efficient way to meet these requirements?
       - **Deploy two instances in each of three Availability Zones.**

19. SA needs to design a centralized logging solution for a group of web applications running on EC2 instances. The sol requires minimal development effort due to budget constraints. Which of the following should the Architect recommend?
       - **Install and configure Amazon CloudWatch Logs agent in the Amazon EC2 instances.**

20. Employees from several companies use an application once a year during a specific 30-day period. The periods are different for each company. Traffic to the application spikes during these 30-day periods. How can the application be designed to handle these traffic spikes?
       - **Use an Auto Scaling group to scale the number of EC2 instances to match the site traffic.**

21. SA is about to deploy an API on multiple EC2 instances in Auto Scaling group behind an ELB. The support team has following operational requirements: 
They get an alert when the requests per second go over 50,000, they get an alert when latency goes over 5 seconds, they can validate how many times a day users call the API requesting highly sensitive data. Which combination of steps does SA need to take to satisfy these operational requirements?
       - **Create a custom CloudWatch metric to monitor the API for data access.**
       - **Ensure that detailed monitoring for the EC2 instances is enabled.**     

22. An interactive, dynamic web runs on EC2 instances in single subnet behind an ELB CLB. Which design changes will make the site more highly available?
       - **Move some Amazon EC2 instances to a subnet in a different way.**

23. Multi-tiered architecture for an application with public facing web-tier. EC2 instances running in application tier to not be accessible directly from the internet.
       - **Deploy the web and application instances in a private subnet. Provision an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet. Install an internet gateway and use security groups to control communications between the layers.**

24. Company creates business critical 3D images every night. Images are batch-processed every Friday and require an uninterrupted 48 hours to complete. What is the most cost effective EC2 pricing model for this scenario?
       - **Scheduled Reserved Instances**

25. SA is designing a highly available web application on AWS. The data served on the website is dynamic and is pulled from DynamoDB. All users are geographically close to one another. How can SA make the application highly available?
    - **Host the application on EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones. Use an Auto Scaling group coupled with an Application Load Balancer.**

26. App runs on EC2 instance behind ELB ALB. Instances run in an EC2 Auto scaling group across multiple AZ. App provides a RESTful interface with both syn and async operations. The asyn operations require up to 5 mins to complete. Although app must remain available at all times, after bus hours, the traffic going to app is greatly reduced and often results in Auto Scaling group running the minimum number fo On-Demand Instances. What should SA recommend to optimize the cost of the environment after business hours?
       - **Purchase Reserved Instances for the minimum number of Auto Scaling instances.**
  
  application must remain available at all times" = reserved instances for the time it is running.
