## CloudFormation

1. Cloud formation is the IAC tool ( infrastructure as code)
2. Replicate the environment of on premises to AWS by using CloudFormation.
3. For Availability Multi AZ, For Performance Read Replica

Scenes:
1. Clients notice that their engineers often make mistakes when creating SQS queues for their backend system.
 - Which action should SA recommend to improve this process?
       - **Use AWS CloudFormation Templates to manage Amazon SQS queue creation.**

2. SA is designing a new app that will  be hosted on EC2 instances.
 - This app has the following traffic requirements.
 - Accept HTTP(80)/HTTPS(443) traffic from the internet. 
 -  Accept FTP(21) traffic from the finance team servers at 10.10.2.0/24.
 -  Which of the following AWS cloudformation snippets correctly declares inbound security group rules that meet requirements and prevent unauthorized access to additional services on the instance?
       - **IpProtocol:"udp""FromPort":"443""ToPort":"443""CidrIp":"0.0.0.0/0"**
       - **IpProtocol:"udp""FromPort":"80""ToPort":"80""CidrIp":"0.0.0.0/0"**
       - **IpProtocol:"udp""FromPort":"21""ToPort":"21""CidrIp":"10.10.2.0/24"**

TCP/80 and TCP/443 from any

3. SA has designed a VPC that meets all necessary security requirements for their organization. 
 - Any applications deployed in the organization must use this VPC design.
 - How can project teams deploy, manage and delete VPCs that meet this design with LEAST admin effort?
    - **Deploy an AWS CloudFormation template that defines components of the VPC.**

4. SA was tasked with reviewing several templates that build VPCs and ensuring that they meet specific security requirements.
 - After reviewing the templates, the architect realizes that all of the templates are missing important security best practices.
 - How should SA do to implement security best practices in efficient manner?
       - **Provide the teams a nested AWS CloudFormation template that builds the VPC correctly**

5. SA needs to use AWS to implement pilot light disaster recovery for a three-tier web app hosted in an on-premises datacenter.
 - Which sol allows rapid provision of working, fully scaled production environment?
       - **Continuously replicate the production database server to Amazon RDS. Use AWS CloudFormation to deploy the application and any additional servers if necessary.**

## More:

1. Way to completely script your cloud environement.
2. Quick start is bunch of cloudformation template already built by sol architect allowing you to create complex environments very quickly.
