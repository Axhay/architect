## SQS

1. FIFO will deliver atleast once and no duplicates.
2. Default queue could deliver twice can have duplicates.
3. Decoupling this element and having it processed by separate workers allows the rest of the system to not suffer the impact of the slow-running worker.

## More:
1. Is web service that gives you access to message queue that can be used to store messages while waiting for computer to process them.
2. Can decouple component of an application so they run independently, easing message management between components.
3. Any component of an application can store message in a failsafe queue. Message can contain up to 256KB of text in any format. 
4. Any component can later retrieve message programatically using SQS API.
5. Queue resolves issue that arises if the producer is producing work faster than consumer can process it, or if the producer or consumer are only intermittently connected to the network.
6. Standard queues lets you have unlimited number of transactions per second.
- It makes sure messages is delivered atleast once.
- However, more than one copy of message may be delivered our of order
- Provides best effort ordering which ensures that messages are delivered in same order as they are sent.
7. FIFO queues:
- Complement standard queues. 
- Exactly once processing and FIFO delivery.
- Order in which message are sent and received is strictly preserved.
- Message remains available until the consumer processes and deletes it.
- Duplicates are not introduced in queue.
- Limited to 300 transactions per second, but they have all capabilities or standard queues.


## Tips
1. Fast way to decouple your infrastructure
2. SQS is pull based not push based.
3. Message are 256Kb in size.
4. Message can be kept in the queue from 1 min to 14 days, default retention period being 4 days.
5. Standard SQS and FIFO SQS.
6. Standard order is not guaranteed and message can be delivered more than once.
7. FIFO order is strictly maintained and message are delivered only once.
8. Visibility time out is amount of time message is invisible in SQS queue after a reader picks up that message.
9. If job is not processed within that time, message will become visible again and another reader will process it. This can result in same message delivered twice.
10. Visibility time out max is 12 hrs.
11. SQS guarantee that your message will be processed at least once.
12. SQS long polling is the way to retreive messages from your SQS queues.
13. While regular short polling returns immediately, long polling doe snot return a response until the message arrives in a message queue, or the long poll times out.

## SWF:
1. Is a web service that makes it easy to collaborate work across distribubetd application components.
2. SWF enables applications for range of use cases, including media processing, web application backends, business process workflow and analytics pipelines to be designed as coordination of task.
3. Tasks represent invocation of various processing steps in an application which can be performed by executable code, web service calls, human actions and scripts.

## SQF actors:
1. Workflow starters:
- an application that can initiate (start) a workflow.
- could be your ecommerce website following placement of an order or mobile app searching for bus times.
2. Deciders:
- Control flow or activity tasks in a workflow execution.
- It something has finished in a workflow, decider decides what to do next.
3. Activity workers:
- Carry out activity tasks.

## SWF vs SQS
1. SQS has retention period of up to 14 days, SWF executions can last up to 1 year.
2. SWF presents task oriented API, SQS is message oriented API.
3. SWF ensures task is assigned only once and never duplicated.
4. SQS you need to handle duplicated messages and may also need to ensure message is processed only once.
5. SWF keeps track of all tasks and events in the application.
6. With SQS, you need to implement own application level tracking, esp if your application uses multiple queues.

## SNS vs SQS
1. Both messaging service in AWS.
2. SNS-Push and SQS is Pull

## SNS benefits tips
1. Instanataneous push based delivery (no polling)
2. Simple APIs and easy integration with applications.
3. Flexible message deliverya cross multiple transport protocols.
4. Inexpensive pay as you go model with no upfront costs.
5. Web based AWS management console offers the simplicity of the point and click interface.
