## MQ

1. Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud. Message brokers allow different software systems–often using different programming languages, and on different platforms–to communicate and exchange information. With Amazon MQ, you can use industry standard APIs and protocols for messaging, including JMS, NMS, AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket. You can easily move from any message broker that uses these standards to Amazon MQ because you don’t have to rewrite any messaging code in your applications.

Scenes:

1. Company migration an on-premises application to AWS. App uses corporate message broker, passing messages between layers by using MQTT protocol. Due to time and budget constraint, company cannot rewrite the application and cannot manage new message broker on EC2 instances. Which service to use to allow customer to migrate app to AWS?
