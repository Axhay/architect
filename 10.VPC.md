## Virtual Private Cloud

1. Data never leave AWS network - VPC endpoint.
2. Latest generation of VPC endpoints used by AWS Systems manager are powered by Private link.
3. Eggress only for IPv6.
4. AWS Privatelink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications, securely on the Amazon network. PII
5. VPC flog logs is a feature that enable to capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. 
6. VPC endpoint enables privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS private link without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection or AWS Direct Connect connection.
7. Flow logs is the only service that allows you to monitor the flow of Network IP addresses.
8. VPC peering is a communication within AWS accounts and internet access is not required.
9. You can specify allow rules but not deny rules.
10. A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.
11. If you host a website on multiple Amazon EC2 instances, you can distribute traffic to your website across the instances by using an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer.

Scenes:

1. App server should be in private subnet without access to the Internet.
  - Sol must retrieve and upload files to S3 bucket.
        - **Use Amazon S3 VPC endpoints.**

2. App running in private subnet accesses DynamoDB table.
  - There is security requirement that data never leaves AWS network.
  - How is this requirement met?
        - **Create a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB and configure the endpoint policy**

3. SA creating an application running on VPC that needs to access AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
  - Network security rules prohibit route table entry with 0.0.0.0./0 destination
  - Which infrastructure allows access to AWS service meeting requirements?
       - **AWS PrivateLink**

4. Design VPC that requires access to remote API server using IPv6.
  - Resources within the VPC should not be accessed directly from Internet.
  - How can this be achieved?
       - **Attach an egress-only internet gateway and update the routing tables.**

5. Company wants to create app that transmit protected health information to thousands of service consumers in different AWS accounts.
  - App servers will sit in private VPC subnets.
  - Routing for the app must be fault tolerant.
  - What to do to meet this requirement?
       - **Create VPC endpoint service and grant permissions to specific service consumers to create a connection.**

6. Security team reviewed their companys VPC flow logs and found that traffic is being directed to the internet.
  - App in the VPC uses EC2 instances for compute and S3 for storage.
  - Companys goal is to eliminate internet access and allow app to continue to function.
  - What change should be made in VPC before  updating route table?
       - **Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 access.**

7. Most secure way to allow applications to access service endpoints in the same region.
       - **Use AWS PrivateLink**

8. Credit card processing app hosted on an on-premises server, needs to communicate directly with the database hosted on EC2 instance running in an private subnet of vpc.

  - Compliance req state that end to end communication should be encrypted.
  - Which solution will ensure that this requirement is met?
        - **Use HTTPS for traffic over the VPN connection between the VPC and the on-premises datacenter.**
        - **Communication are encrypted and secured simply by using VPN.**

9. SA is given following requirements for a companys VPC:
    - Two tiered app with web and db tier
    - All web traffic to environment should be directed from internet to ALB
    - Web servers and DB should not obtain public IP address or subnet with any other device.
    - Environment be highly available within same VPC for all services.
    - What is the min number of subnets that SA need for best practices?
        - **6**
        - 2 public subnets for ELB
        - 2 private subnets for web server.
        - 2 private subnets for databases.

10. Company plans to use VPC to deploy web app consisting of ELB, a fleet of web and app servers, and RDS MySQL db that should not be accessible from the Internet.
  - Proposed design must be highly available and distributed over two AZ.
  - What is most  appropriate VPC design for this use case?
       - **Two public subnet for ELB, two private subnets for web servers and two private subnets for RDS.**

11. SA is designing an app on AWS that will connect to on-premise data center through VPN connection.
  - Sol must be able to log network traffic over VPN. 
  - Which service logs this network traffic?
       - **Amazon VPC flow logs**

12. SA is designing VPC.
  - App in VPC must have private connectivity to DynamoDB in the same AWS region.
  - Design should route DynamoDB traffic through
       - **VPC endpoint**

13. Company requires that source, destination and protocol of all IP packets be recorded when traversing a private subnet.
  -  What is the MOST secure and reliable method of accomplishing this goal?
       - **Create VPC flow logs on the subnet.**

14. SA is designing a new app that needs to access data in different AWS account located in the same region.
  - The data must not be accessed over the Internet.
  - Which solution will meet these requirements with LOWEST cost?
       - **Establish a VPC peering connection between accounts.**

15. SA is designing network architecture for an app that has compliance requirements.
  - App will be hosted on EC2 instances in private subnet and will be using S3 for storing data.
  - Compliance requirements mandate that the data cannot traverse the public internet.
  - What is the MOST secure way to satisfy this requirement?
       - **Use a VPC endpoint.**

16. Dev team is building an app with front end and back end app tiers.
  - Each tier consists of EC2 instances behind an ELB CLB.
  - Instances run in Auto scaling group across multi AZ.
  - Network team has allocated the 10.0.0.0/24 address space for this app.
  - Only the front end load balancer should be exposed to the Internet.
  - There are concerns about limited size of address space and ability of each tier to scale.
  - What should the VPC subnet design be in each AZ? 
       - **One public subnet for the load balancer tier, one public subnet for the front-end tier, and one private subnet for the backend tier.**

17. SA is designing VPC. Applications in VPC must have private connectivity to DynamoDB in the same AWS region. The design should route DynamoDB traffic through:
       - **VPC endpoint**

18. Company hosts a popular web app. The web app connects to DB running in private VPC subnet. The web servers must be accessible only to customers on an SSL connection. RDS MySQL DB server must be accessible only from web servers. How should SA design a solution to meet requirements without impacting running apps?
    - **Open an HTTPS port on the security group for web servers and set the source to 0.0.0.0/0. Open the MySQL port on the database security group and attach it to the MySQL instance. Set the source to Web Server Security Group.**

19. A workload in an VPC consists of a single web tier server launched from a custom AMI. Session state is stored in a DB. How should a SA modify this workload to be both highly available and scalable?
    - **Create a launch configuration with the AMI ID of the web server image. Create an Auto Scaling group using the newly-created launch configuration, and a desired capacity of two web servers across multiple Availability Zones. Use an ALB to balance traffic across the Auto Scaling group.**
