## Lambda Functions

1. Improve fault tolerance of existing Python application.
2. Least operation overhead.
3. Serverless service.
4. AWS will manage provisioning and managing.
5. Redesign the process for high availability.
6. Lambda is triggered in 3 ways:
  a. API Gateway event.
  b. DynamoDB events.
  c. S3 events.

Scenes:

1. Prediction process needs access to trained models stored on S3 bucket.
  - Few seconds to process the image and make predictions.
  - Process not overly resource intensive.
  - Does not need specialized hardware.
  - Takes less than 512MB to run.
  - Most cost effective solution:
       - **Lambda Functions**

2. Lambda function needs access to RDS for SQL server instance.
  - It is against the company policy to store passwords in lambda functions.
  - How can SA enable lambda functions to retreive the DB password without violating company policy?
       - **Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**
