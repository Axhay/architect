## SQS

1. FIFO will deliver atleast once and no duplicates.
2. Default queue could deliver twice can have duplicates.
3. Decoupling this element and having it processed by separate workers allows the rest of the system to not suffer the impact of the slow-running worker.

Scenes:

1. User submit requests to a service that takes several minutes to process. SA needs to ensure that these requests are processed at least once, and that the service has the ability to handle large increases in number of requests. How should these requirements be met?
    - **Put the requests into an Amazon SQS queue and configure Amazon EC2 instances to poll the queue**

2. App uses an SQS queue as transport mechanism to deliver data to a group of EC2 instances for processing. Application owner wants to add mechanism to archive incoming data without modifying application code on EC2 instances. How can this application be re-architected to archive the data without modifying the processing instances?
    - **Use an Amazon SNS topic to fan out the data to the SQS queue in addition to a Lambda function that records the data to an S3 bucket.**

3. An organization runs an online voting system for TV program. During broadcasts, hundreds of thousands of votes are submitted within minutes and sent too a front end fleet of auto-scaled EC2 instances. The EC2 instances push the votes to an RDBMS database. The DB is unable to keep up with front-end connection requests. What is the MOST efficient and cost effective way of ensuring that votes are processed in timely manner?
    - **Each front-end node should send votes to an Amazon SQS queue. Provision worker instances to read the SQS queue and process the message information into RDBMS database.**

4. Restaurant reservation application needs to maintain waiting list. When a customer tries to reserve a table, and none are available, customer must be put on waiting list, and the application must notify the customer when a table becomes free. What service should the SA recommend to ensure that the system respects the order in which the customer requests are put onto the waiting list?
    - **A FIFO queue in Amazon SQS**

5. SA is designing customer order processing applications that will likely have high usage spikes. What should the Architect do to ensure that customer orders are not lost before being written to an RDS database?
    - **Have the orders written into an Amazon SQS queue.**
    - **Scale the number of processing nodes based on pending order volume.**

6. Legacy app currently send messages through single EC2 instance, which then routes the messages to the appropriate destinations. The EC2 instance is a bottleneck and single point of failure, so company would like to address these issues. Which services could address this architectural use cases?
    - **Amazon SNS**
    - **Amazon SQS**

7. App relies on messages being sent and received in order. The volume will never exceed more than 300 transactions each second. Which service should be used?
    - **Amazon SQS**

8. Website experiences unpredictable traffic. During peak traffic times, the DB is unable to keep up with the write request.Which AWS service will help decouple the web app from DB?
    - **Amazon SQS**

9. Company has web application to make requests to backend API service. API service is behind ELB running on EC2 instances. Most API service endpoint calls finish quickly but one endpoint that makes calls to create objectsÂ  in external service takes a long time to complete. These long running calls are causing client timeouts and increasing overall system latency. What to do to minimize system throughput impact of slow-running endpoint?
    - **Use Amazon SQS to offload the long-running requests for asynchronous processing by separate workers.**

10. SA designs three-tier web application to allow customers to upload pictures from mobile application. App will generate thumbnail of picture and return message to user confirming image successfully uploaded. Generation of thumbnail may take up to 5 seconds. To provide a sub second response time to the customers uploading the images, SA wants to separate web tier from application tier. Which service allow the presentation tier to dispatch request to application tier?
    - **Amazon SQS**

11. When designing SQS message processing solution, messages in queue must be processed before maximum retention time has elapsed. Which actions will meet this requirement?
    - **Use Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group with scaling triggered based on the queue length**
    - **Increase the SQS queue attribute for the message retention period**

12. An application publishes SNS messages in response to several events. An Lambda function subscribes to these messages. Occasionally the function will fail while processing a message, so the original event message must be preserved for root cause analysis. What architecture will meet these requirements without changing the workflow?
    - **Configure a Dead Letter Queue for the Amazon SNS topic.**
