## Network Load Balancer

1. Choose an Application Load Balancer when you need a flexible feature set for your web applications with HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
Choose a Network Load Balancer when you need ultra-high performance, TLS offloading at scale, centralized certificate deployment, support for UDP, and static IP addresses for your application.
2. Host-based routing use host conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the host name in the host header. This enables ALB to support multiple domains using a single load balancer.
Path-based routing use path conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request. Each path condition has one path pattern. If the URL in a request matches the path pattern in a listener rule exactly, the request is routed using that rule.
3. The Health check is configured for ELB and failing, however the Auto Scaling needs to use the ELB health check, in addition to the system checks, to determine if the instance in healthy. Hence the Auto Scaling group needs to be updated to use ELB health check for terminating the instances.
4. Application Load Balancer. Keywords: Distribute based on URL = Path based routing for ALB
5. For example, previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrieval. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance, and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes.

Scenes:

1. Customer has application used by enterprise customers outside of AWS. Some of them use legacy firewalls that cannot whitelist by DNS name, but whitelist based only on IP address. App is deployed in two AZ, with one EC2 instance in each that has Elastic IP address. Customer wants to whitelist only two IP addresses, but the two existing EC2 instances cannot sustain the amount of traffic. What can SA do to support customer and allow for more capacity?
       - **Create a Network Load Balancer with an interface in each subnet, and assign a static IP address to each subnet.**
       - **Switch the two existing EC2 instances for an Auto Scaling group, and register them with the Network Load Balancer.**

2. SA is designing web application that runs on EC2 instances behind a load balancer. All data in transit must be encrypted. Which solutions will meet the encryption requirement?
    - **Use a Network Load Balancer (NLB) with a TCP listener, then terminateÂ SSL on EC2 instances.**
    - **Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with an HTTPS listener, then install SSL certificates on the ALB and EC2 instances.**

3. Large media site have multiple applications in ECS. SA needs to use content metadata and route traffic to specific services. What is the most efficient method to perform this task?
    - **Use an AWS Application Load Balancer with host-based routing option to route traffic to the correct service.**

4. A client has setup an Auto Scaling group associated with load balancer. Client noticed that instances launched by Auto Scaling group are reported unhealthy as a result of ELB health check, but these unhealthy instances are not being terminated. What can solutions architect do to ensure that the instances marked unhealthy will be terminated and replaced?
    - **Change the health check type to ELB for the Auto Scaling group.**

5. Company has asked SA to modify its AWS hosted internal application to allow for load balancing. The customer requests always come from the company domain (example.net). The company requires that incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic is routed based on the path element of the URL in the request. Which implementation can satisfy all requirements?
    - **Configure an Application Load Balancer with listeners for appropriate path patterns for the target group.**

6. Company needs to capture all client connection information from its ALB every 5 mins. This data will be used to analyze traffic patterns and troubleshoot the application. How can SA meet this requirement?
    - **Enable Access Logs on the Application Load Balancer.**

7. App tier currently hosts two web services on same set of instances, listening on different ports. Which AWS service should SA use to route traffic to the service based on the incoming request path?
    - **AWS Application Load Balancer**

8. SA is designing microservices-based app using ECS. App includes a WebSocket component, and the traffic needs to be distributed between microservices based on the URL. Which service should the Architect choose to distribute the workload?
    - **ELB Application Load Balancer**

9. Admin is hosting an app on single EC2 instance, which users can access by public hostname. Admin is adding a second instance, but does not want users to have to decide between many public hostnames. Which AWS service will decouple users from EC2 instances?
    - **Amazon ELB**

10. SA is designing a highly-available website that is served by multiple web servers hosted outside of AWS. If an instance becomes unresponsive, SA needs to remove it from rotation. What is the MOST efficient way to fulfill this requirement?
    - **Use an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer.**

11. SA is designing sol with Lambda where diff environment require different database passwords. What should SA do to accomplish this in a secure and scalable way?
    - **Use encrypted AWS Lambda environmental variables.**

12. SA is designing the solution to store large quantities of event data in S3. Architect anticipates that the workload will exceed 100 requests each second. What should SA do in S3 to optimizate performance?
    - **Randomize a key name prefix.**
