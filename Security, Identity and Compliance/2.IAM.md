## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

1. Assigning an role is giving an access.
2. IAM users cannnot be attached to EC2 instance but IAM role can be attached to EC2 instance.
3. For AWS service to service interaction without need to create credentials, we use IAM roles. In that case we define a policy list RDS instances, use it to create a role and attach the role to the lambda function.
4. For applications running outside of AWS such as on-premises and third-party automation, it will need access keys, NOT IAM Role

## More:
1. Allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS console
2. Centralized control of your AWS account
- Shared access to your AWS account
- Granular permissions
- MFA
- Provide temporary access for users/devices and services where necessary
- Allows you to setup your own password rotation policy
- Integrates with many different AWS services
3. Users: Each users such as people, employee of an organization etc.
4. Groups:
- A collection of users. Each user in a group will inherit the permissions of the group.
5. Policies:
- Made up of documents, called policy documents.
- These documents are in JSON format and they give permissions as to what a user/group/role is able to do.
6. Roles:
- You create roles and then assign them to AWS resources.
7. IAM is universal. It does not apply to regions at this time.
8. The root account is simply the account created when you first setup your AWS account. It has complete Admin access.
9. New users have no permissions
10. New users are assigned Access key ID and secret access keys when first created.
11. These are not the same as password.You cannot use the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key to login to the console. You can use this to access AWS via the APIs and command line.
12. You only get to view these once. If you lose them, you have to regenerate them. So, save them in a secure location.
13. Always setup MFA on your root account
14. You can create and customize your own password rotation policy
