 ## Security Groups and ALB

  1. Application Load Balancers have no IP address so using the security group for it is the best fit in this case.
  2. Unlike a traditional web hosting model, inbound network traffic filtering should not be confined to the edge; it should also be applied at the host level. Amazon EC2 provides a feature named security groups. A security group is analogous to an inbound network firewall, for which you can specify the protocols, ports, and source
  IP ranges that are allowed to reach your EC2 instances. You can assign one or more security groups to each EC2 instance. Each security group routes the appropriate traffic to each instance. Security groups can be configured so that only specific subnets or IP addresses have access to an EC2 instance. Or they can reference other security groups to limit access to EC2 instances that are in specific groups.
  3. ALB doesn't have an IP Address.
  4. Using Redis AUTH command can improve data security by requiring the user to enter a password before they are granted permission to execute Redis commands on a password-protected Redis server
  5. Security Groups only allow you to 'Allow' traffic, not 'Deny' it.

   You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.
