 ## Security Groups and ALB

  1. Application Load Balancers have no IP address so using the security group for it is the best fit in this case.
  2. Unlike a traditional web hosting model, inbound network traffic filtering should not be confined to the edge; it should also be applied at the host level. Amazon EC2 provides a feature named security groups. A security group is analogous to an inbound network firewall, for which you can specify the protocols, ports, and source
  IP ranges that are allowed to reach your EC2 instances. You can assign one or more security groups to each EC2 instance. Each security group routes the appropriate traffic to each instance. Security groups can be configured so that only specific subnets or IP addresses have access to an EC2 instance. Or they can reference other security groups to limit access to EC2 instances that are in specific groups.
  3. ALB doesn't have an IP Address.
  4. Using Redis AUTH command can improve data security by requiring the user to enter a password before they are granted permission to execute Redis commands on a password-protected Redis server
  5. Security Groups only allow you to 'Allow' traffic, not 'Deny' it.

   Security Group Basics
   The following are the basic characteristics of security groups for your VPC:
   You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.

  Scenes:

  1. Application runs on VPCÂ  on EC2 instance behind ALB. Traffic to EC2 instances must be limited to traffic from ALB. Based on these requirements, the security group configuration must allow traffic from:
       - **the security group attached to the Application Load Balancer.**

  2. SA is designing architecture for a web application that will be hosted on AWS. Internet users will access applications using HTTP and HTTPS. How to design traffic control requirements?
        - **Allow inbound ports for HTTP and HTTPS in the security group used by the web servers.**
  
  3. SA is designing multi-tier application consisting of ALB, RDS instance, Auto scaling group on EC2 instance. Each tier is in separate subnet. There are some EC2 instances in the subnet that belong to another application. RDS database instance should accept traffic only from EC2 instances in Auto scaling group. What to do to meet these requirements?
        - **Configure the inbound rules on the security group associated with the RDS database instance. Set the source to the security group associated with instances in the Auto Scaling group.**
  
  4. SA is designing an application that will run on ECS behind an ALB. For security reasons, EC2 host instances for the ECS cluster are in private subnet. What to do to ensure the incoming traffic to host instances is from ALB only?
        - **Modify the security group used by the EC2 cluster to allow incoming traffic from the security group used by the ALB only.**
  
  5. Organization is deploying ElastiCache for Redis and requires password protection to improve their data security posture. Which solution should a SA recommend?
        - **Redis Auth**
  
  6. Web app is running on EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load balancing ALB. EC2 instances should receive no traffic, except for web requests to the application. Based on these requirements, what security group rules should be put on the EC2 instances?
       - **An inbound rule allowing traffic from the security group attached to the ALB**

  7. SA is designing three-tier web app that includes an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances running behind ELB Classic Load Balancer. Sec team requires that all web servers to be accessible only through a Load Balancer, and that none of the web servers are directly accessible from Internet. How should Architect meet these requirements?
       - **Configure the web tier security group to allow only traffic from the ELB Classic Load Balancer.**
  
  8. SA needs to allow developers to have SSH connectivity to web servers. Requirements are as follows: limit access to users origination from corporate network, web servers cannot have SSH access directly from the internet, web servers reside in a private subnet. Which combination of steps must SA complete to meet these requirements?
        - **Create a bastion host with security group rules that only allow traffic from the corporate network.**
        - **Configure the web servers' security group to allow SSH traffic from a bastion host.**
  
  9. Two auto scaling apps, A and B, currently run within a shared set of subnets. SA wants to make sure that app A can make request to app B, but app B should be denied from making request to app A. Which is the simplest sol to achieve this policy?
        - **Using security groups that reference the security groups of the other application**
  
  10. Company hosts a two-tier app that consists of publicly accessible web server that communicates with private database. Only HTTPS port 443 traffic to the web server must be allowed from the internet. Which of the following options will achieve these requirements?
        - **Security group rule that allows inbound Internet traffic for port 443.**
        - **Network ACL rule that allows port 443 inbound and all ports outbound for Internet traffic.**
      A = Inbound on Port 443 is fine as Security Groups are stateful (allow the traffic to return to the remote party without an explicit rule)
      C = Inbound 443 on the Network ACL is a given, however, Network ACL's are stateless and therefore need configuring. In this case, the web server replies on a range of ports and therefore it is required that they are all open rather than simply 443 as stated in answer E.

  11. SA is designing a three-tier web app. The architect wants to restrict access to the DB tier to accept traffic from app servers only. However, these app servers are in an Auto Scaling group and may vary in quantity. How should SA configure DB servers to meet the requirements?
        - **Configure the database security group to allow database traffic from the application server security group.**
        simple way to execute the solution via security group.
