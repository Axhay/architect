## API Gateway

1. Lambda and API because it has to scale based on demand. SPOT instances do work for stateless apps, should be in a comparable price versus lambda but the issue is elasticity and how these instances are going to be available (or the lack of certainty they will).
2. Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create REST and WebSocket APIs that act as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, any web application, or real-time communication applications.
API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management. API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs.

## More:

1. Users->API Gateway-> Lambda, EC2 and DynamoDB
2. Exposes HTTPs endpoints to define RESTful API.
3. Severless-ly connects to services like lambda and DynamoDB.
4. Send each API endpoint to different target.
5. Run efficiently with lost cost.
6. Scale effortlessly.
7. Connect to Cloudwatch to log all requests for monitoring.
8. Maintain multiple versions of your API.
9. Track and control usage by API key.

## Configure:
1. Define an API (container)
2. Define resources and nested resources (URL paths)
3. For each resource:
- Select supported HTTP methods (verbs)
- Set security
- Choose target(such as EC2, lambda, dynamodb etc)
- Set request and response transformations.

## Deploy:

1. Set API to stage.
2. Uses API gateway domain by default.
3. Can use custom domain.
4. Now supports AWS certificate manager. Free SSL/TLS certs.

## Same origin policy:

1. Under the policy, web browser permits scripts contained in a first web page to access data in second web page but only if both web pages have same origin.
2. This is done to prevent cross-site scripting (CSS) attacks.
- enforced by web browsers.
- ignored by tools like postman and curl.

## CORS:

1. Is one way the server at the other end (not client code in the browser) can relax the same-origin policy.
2. It is a mechanism that allows restricted resources(e.g fonts) on the web page  to be requested from another domian outside the domain from which first resource was served.

## Tips:
1. It has caching capabilities to increase performance.
2. Low cost and scales automatically.
3. Can throttle API gateway to prevent attacks.
4. Can log results to cloudwatch.
5. CORS is enforced by client.

## API Gateway caching
1. Enable API gateway caching in API gateway to cache your endpoint response.
2. With caching, can reduce number of calls made to your endpoint.
3. When you enable caching for stage, API gateway caches responses from your endpoint for specified time to live (TTL) period in seconds.
4. API gateway then responds to the request by looking up the endpoint response from the cache instaead of making requests to your endpoint.
