## Route 53

1. MultiValue Answer Routing would fit to random queries with health checks.
2. You can use the cloudfront with Route 53 Geolocation Routing. But the location wise content delivery is already enabled in cloudfront, so geolocation policy wont help that much. If you are not using cloudfront and you want to distribute traffic based on user location, then you can use Route53
3. For an active-active system, Geolocation, Geoproximity, Latency, Multivalue, or Weighted policies would work.

Route 53 returns all values to a user in random order.

1. Simple routing:
 - One record with multiple IP addresses

2. Weighted routing:
 - Split your traffic based on different weights assigned.
 Ex: 10% traffic to US-EAST-1, 90% traffic to EU-WEST-1
 Tips: Can set health checks on individual record sets.
 If record set fails health check, it is removed from Route53 until it passes health check.
 Set SNS notification to alert you if health check fails.

3. Latency based routing:
 - Route your traffic based on lowest network latency for your end user
 Tips: Route53 will send traffic to EU-WEST-2 as it has much lower latency than AP-SOUTHEAST-2.

4. Failover Routing Policy:
 - When you want to create active/passive setup.
 - Primary site to setup in EU-WEST-2 and secondary DR site to be set up in AP-SOUTHEAST-2.
 - Route53 monitors health of your primary site using health check.
 Tips: Route53 sends traffic to AP-SOUTHEAST-2 due to detected failure in EU-WEST-2.

5. Geolocation Routing policy:
 - Let you choose where traffic to be sent based on geographical location of your user.
 - Tips: Route53 will send European customers to EU-WEST-1 and US customers to US-EAST-1.

6. Geoproximity routing (Traffic flow only)
 - Route traffic to your resources based on geographical location of your users and resources.
 - Choose to route more traffic or less to given resource by specifying a value known as bias.
 - Bias expands or shrinks size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource.

7. Multivalue answer policy
 - Lets you configure Amazon Route 53 to return multiple values such as IP address for your web servers in response to DNS queries.
 - Lets you check health of each resource, so Route 53 returns only values for healthy resources.
 - Similar to simple routing however it allows to put health checks on each record set.
