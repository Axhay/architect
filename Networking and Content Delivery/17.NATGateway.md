## NAT Gateway

1. Note If you have resources in multiple Availability Zones and they share one NAT gateway, in the event that the NAT gateway’s Availability Zone is down, resources in the other Availability Zones lose internet access. To create an Availability Zone-independent architecture, create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone and configure your routing to ensure that resources use the NAT gateway in the same Availability Zone. 
2. Connect to the Internet using Network Address Translation (private subnets) – Private subnets can be used for instances that you do not want to be directly addressable from the Internet. Instances in a private subnet can access the Internet without exposing their private IP address by routing their traffic through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway in a public subnet.
3. Reason, The web Servers in web subnet can get Internet via ELB or IGW but private cannot go through ELB and IGW. They either need Nat Instance or Nat Gateway. since NAT instances are not mentioned then it must be Nat Gateway.
4. you must always create your NAT gateway in a public subnet that already has a defined route to 0.0.0.0/0 through an internet gateway. and assign an Elastic IP to the NAT gateway.
5. You have a limit on the number of NAT gateways you can create in an Availability Zone. 

## More:

1. When creating NAT instance, disable source/destination check on the instance.
2. NAT instance must be in public subnet.
3. There needs a route out of private subnet to the NAT instance, in order for this to work.
4. Behind security group.
5. Redundant inside AZ.
6. Preferred by enterprise.
7. Starts at 5Gbps and scale up to 45Gbps.
8. No need to patch.
9. Not associated with security groups.
10. Auto assigned a public IP address.
11. No need to disable source/destination IP checks.
12. If we have resources in multiple AZ and they share one NAT gateway, in the event that NAT gateway AZ is down, resources in other AZ lose internet access.
13. To create AZ independent architecture, create NAT gateway in each AZ and configure your routing to ensure that resources use the NAT gateway in the same AZ.

## AMIs:
1. Select AMI based on region, OS, Architecture(32/64), launch permissions, storage for root device(Instance store), Ephemeral storage, EBS backed volumes.

## EBS vs Instance store volumes:
1. All AMIs are categorized as either backed by EBS or backed by instance store.
2. For EBS volumes: root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from EBS snapshot.
3. For instance store volumes: root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from template stored in S3.


## NAT instance vs NAT gateway
1. NAT instance:
 - Disable source/destination checks on instance.
 - Must be in public subnet.
 - Route out to private subnet to NAT instance, for this to work.
 - Behind security group.

2. NAT Gateways:
 - No need to disable source/destination checks
 - Not associated with security groups.
 - Redundant inside AZ.
 - Starts at 5Gbps and scales currently to 45Gbps.
 - Automatically assigned public IP address.
 - Remember to update your route tables.
