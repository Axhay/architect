## RDS - Relational Database Service.

1. With RDS Storage Auto Scaling, you simply set your desired maximum storage limit, and Auto Scaling takes care of the rest.
2. You can only enable encryption for an Amazon RDS DB instance when you create it, not after the DB instance is created.
For an Amazon RDS encrypted DB instance, all logs, backups, and snapshots are encrypted.
3. DynamoDB is HA. But Postgre is'nt. So a Multi AZ is needed.
4. You can enable point-in-time recovery using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the DynamoDB API. When it's enabled, point-in-time recovery provides continuous backups until you explicitly turn it off.
DR takes things to a completely new level, wherein you need to be able to recover from a different region that’s separated by over 250 miles.
5. Think read replicas when performance is mentioned. Think Multi-AZ when high availability is mentioned
6. In a Multi AZ, AWS runs just one DB but copies the data synchronously to the standby replica
The question targets Read Contention( responsiveness ) and write is not an issue and hence the Read Replicas.
7. The application servers and database must be secure. so it must be on a private subnet. ELB already in public subnet .Elb will communicate to private subnet.

Scenes:

1. Customer deploying production portal application on AWS.
 - The database tier has structured data.
 - Company needs a solution that is easily manageable and highly available. 
       - **Use Amazon RDS with a multiple Availability Zone option.**

2. Retail company runs hourly flash sales has performance issue on RDS for PostgreSQL database.
 - DBA identified the issue with performance happens when finance and marketing employees refresh sales dashboards used for reporting real-time sales data. 
 - How to resolve issue without impacting performance?
       - **Create a Read Replica of the RDS PostgreSQL database and point the dashboards at the Read Replica.**

3. Companies Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance may be rebooted for maintenance and to apply patches.
 - This database is critical and potential user disruption must be minimized. 
 - What should SA do in this scenario?
       - **Set RDS MySQL to Multi-AZ.**

4. Company setting new website for online sales.
 - Company will have a web and database tier.
 - Web tier consists of load-balanced, auto-scaled EC2 instance in multiple AZ.
 - Database tier is an RDS Multi AZ deployment. 
 - EC2 instances must connect securely to DB.
 - How should resources be launched?
       - **EC2 instances: private subnet RDS database instances: private subnet Load balancer: public subnet**
ELB can be in public subnet while EC2 and RDS can be in private subnet

5. Company migrating on-prem DB to AWS
 -  Companys backend application produces large amount of DB queries for reporting purposes, and company wants to offload some of those reads to Read Replica, allowing primary database to continue performing efficiently.
 - Which AWS DB platforms will accomplish this?
     - **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**
     - **Amazon RDS for MariaDB**

6. What conditions will cause Multi-AZ RDS failover to occur?
     - **An Availability Zone becomes unavailable**
     - **A failure of the primary database instance**

7. During performance testing of an application, RDS database caused a performance bottleneck.
 - What steps can be taken to improve database performance?
       - **Scale up to a larger RDS instance type.**
       - **Redirect read queries to RDS read replicas.**

8. App running on EC2 has been experiencing performance issues when accessing RDS for Oracle database.
  - The database has been provisioned correctly for average workloads, but there are several usage spikes each day that have saturated the database, causing the application to time out.
  - The application is write-heavy, updating information more often than reading information. 
  - SA has been asked to review the application design.
  - What should the SA recommend to improve performance?
       - **Change the Amazon RDS instance storage type from General Purpose SSD to provisioned IOPS SSD.**
  
9. SA is designing a two tier application for maximum security, with a web tier running on EC2 instances and the data stored in an RDS DB instance.
 - The web tier should accept user access only through HTTPS connections (443) from the Internet, and data must be encrypted in transit to and from DB.
 - What combination of steps will MOST securely meet the stated requirements?
       - **Create a security group for the web tier instances that allows inbound traffic only over port 443.**
       - **Configure the web servers to communicate with RDS by using SSL, and issue certificates to the web tier EC2 instances.**

10. Company has an application that accesses MySQL database installed on a single EC2 instance. 
 - The instance recently experienced a fault and brought down the entire application for several hours.
 - Company wants to address the issue but is concerned about spending too much time modifying application code or managing the legacy application.
 - What should SA recommend to remove this single point of failure with FEWEST changes to the application code and the LEAST amount of admin effort?
       - **Migrate the database to an RDS MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance, and point the application servers to the new RDS instance.**

11. App uses an Amazon RDS MySQL cluster for the DB layer. 
 - DB growth requires periodic resizing of the instance. 
 - Currently, admins check the available disk space manually once a week. 
 - How can this process be improved?
       - **Use Auto Scaling to increase storage size.**

12. SA is designing a solution that will include database in RDS.
 - Corporate security policy mandates that the database, its logs, and its backups are all encrypted - Which is the MOST efficient option to fulfill the security policy using RDS?
    - **Launch an Amazon RDS instance with encryption enabled. Logs and backups are automatically encrypted.**

13. Team has an application that detects new objects being uploaded into S3 bucket. 
 - The uploads trigger a Lambda function to write object metadata into DynamoDB table and RDS PostgreSQL database. 
 - Which action should the team take to ensure high availability?
       - **Enable multi-AZ on the RDS PostgreSQL database.**

14. On-premises database is experiencing significant performance problems when running SQL queries. 
 - With 10 users, the lookups are performing as expected. 
 - As the number of users increases, the lookups take three times longer than expected to return values to an application.
 - Which action should SA take to maintain performance as the user count increases?
    - **Configure Amazon RDS with additional read replicas.**

15. Company has a legal requirement to store point-in time copies of its RDS PostGRESQL db instance in facilities that are at least 200 miles apart. 
 -  Use of which of the following provides the easiest way to comply with this requirement?
       - **Cross-region snapshot copy**

16. Company has RDS DB backing its production website.
 - The sales team needs to run queries against the DB to track training program effectiveness. 
 - Queries against the production database cannot impact performance, and the solution must be easy to maintain.
 - How can these requirements be met?
       - **Use an Amazon RDS read replica of the production database and allow the team to query against it.**

17. Client is migrating legacy web app to AWS cloud. The current system uses an Oracle DB as RDBMS. 
 - Backups occur every night, and the data is stored on-premises.
 - SA must automate the backups and identify a storage solution while keeping costs low.
 - Which AWS service will meet these requirements?
       - **Amazon RDS**

18. SA is deploying a new production MySQL DB on AWS.
 - It is critical that the database is highly available.
 - What should SA do to achieve this goal with RDS?
       - **Enable multi-AZ to create a standby database in a different Availability Zone.**
  
19. Company has RDS managed online transaction processing system that has very heavy read and write. 
 - The SA notices throughput issues with the system.
 - How can the responsiveness of the primary database be improved?
       - **Offload SELECT queries that can tolerate stale data to READ replica.**

20. App stack includes an ELB in public subnet, a fleet of EC2 instances in an auto scaling group, and RDS MySQL cluster. 
 - Users connect to the app from the Internet. 
 - App servers and DB must be secure.
 - How should SA perform this task?
       - **Create a private subnet for the Amazon EC2 instances and a private subnet for the Amazon RDS cluster.**

21. Customer has a production app that frequently overwrites and deletes data, the app requires the most up to date version of the data every time it is requested.
 - Which storage should SA recommend to best accomodate this use case? 
       - **Amazon RDS**

22. Lambda function must execute query against an RDS database in a private subnet.
 - Which steps are required to allow Lambda function to access the RDS database? 
       - **Create the Lambda function within the Amazon RDS VPC.**
       - **Change the ingress rules of the Amazon RDS security group, allowing the Lambda security group.**

23. SA is designing an architecture for mobile gaming app. App is expected to be very popular. 
 - The Architect needs to prevent the RDS MySQL db from becoming a bottleneck due to frequently accessed queries.
 - Which service or feature should the architect add to prevent a bottleneck?
       - **Amazon ElastiCache in front of the RDS MySQL Database**

24. App stores data in RDS PostgreSQL Multi-AZ database instance. Ratio of read to write requests is about 2 to 1. Recent increases in traffic are causing very high latency. How can this problem be solved?
       - **Create a read replica and send all read traffic to it.**

25. Customer is running a critical payroll system in Production environment in one data center and a DR environment in another. App includes load-balanced web servers and failover for MySQL database. Customers DR process is manual and error-prone. For this reason, management has asked IT to migration application to AWS and make it highly available so that IT no longer has to manually fail over the environment. How should SA migrate system to AWS?
       - **Migrate the production environment to span multiple Availability Zones, using Elastic Load Balancing and Multi-AZ Amazon RDS. Decommission the DR environment because it is no longer needed.**

## More:

1. Runs on VMS.
2. Cannot log into these OS ever.
3. RDS is not serverless.
4. Aurora is serverless.
5. RDS is multi-AZ
6. Two different backups for RDS:
 - Automated backups
 - Database snapshots
7. Automated backups:
 - enabled by default
 - backed up data stored in S3.
 - You can free storage space equal to size of your DB
 - If you have RDS instance of 10GB, you will get 10GB worth of storage.
 - Backups taken in a defined window.
 - During backup, stoarge I/O may be suspended while data is being backed up and you may experience elevated latency.
8. Database snapshots
 - Done manually user initiated.
 - They are stored even after you delete original RDS instance, unlike automated backups.
9. Restoring backups:
 - Whenever you restore either automatic or manual snapshot, restored version of DB will be new RDS instance with a new DNS endpoint.
