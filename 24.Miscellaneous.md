## Miscellaneous

Scenarios:
1. Company is moving to AWS. Management has identified a set of approved AWS services that meet all deployment requirements. The company would like to restrict access to all other unapproved services to which employees would have access. Which sol meets these requirements with LEAST amount of operational overhead?
    - **Configure AWS Organizations. Create an organizational unit (OU) and place all AWS accounts into the OU. Apply a service control policy (SCP) to the OU that denies the use of certain services.**

2. Company has asked SA to ensure that data is protected during data transfer to and from S3. Use of which service will protect the data in transit?
    -  **HTTPS**

Use encryption to protect your data
If your use case requires encryption during transmission, Amazon S3 supports the HTTPS protocol, which encrypts data in transit to and from Amazon S3. All AWS SDKs and AWS tools use HTTPS by default.
Note: If you use third-party tools to interact with Amazon S3, contact the developers to confirm if their tools also support the HTTPS protocol.

3. SA is designing a public facing web app for employees to upload images to their social media account. The application consists of multiple EC2 instances behind an ELB, an S3 bucket where uploaded images are stored, and DynamoDB for storing image metadata. Which AWS service can the Architect use to automate the process of updating metadata in the DynamoDB table upon image upload?
    - **AWS Lambda**
lambda can be used when you uploaded an image to S3 and it can trigger lambda function to store image metadata to DynamoDB

4. Which tool analyzes account resources and provides detailed inventory changes over time?
    - **AWS Config**
       AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.

5. After reviewing the logs, startup company noticed large, random spikes in traffic to their web application. The company wants to configure a cost efficient auto scaling solution to support high availability of the web application. Which scaling plan should SA recommend to meet the companyâ€™s needs?
      - **Dynamic**
random=>Dynamic

6. A media company has deployed multi-tier architecture on AWS. Web servers are deployed in two AZ using an Auto scaling group with default autoscaling termination policy. The web servers Auto scaling group currently has 15 instances running. Which instances will be terminated first during a scale-in operation?
       - **The instance in the Availability Zone that has most instances.**

There's also a key piece of information here - 15 instances. As you can't have half an instance, we can assume there is an uneven split between the two AZs (probably 7 at one and 8 at the other).
Therefore scenario #1 of https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html will apply because it there will definitely be an AZ to pick from that has mores instances available to terminate first before going on to other criteria for further scale-in actions.

7. Org designs a mobile application for their customers to upload photos to a site. App needs secure login with MFA. Org wants to limite the initial build time and maintenance of the solution. Which solution should SA recommend to meet these requirements?
       - **Use Amazon Cognito Identity with SMS-based MFA.**

Mobile/web app authentication, think cognito. If supports MFA as well

8. A company is developing several critical long running applications hosted on Docker. How should SA design a solution to meet the scalability and orchestration requirements on AWS?
       - **Use Amazon ECS and Service Auto Scaling.**
ECS = Docker

9. A workload consists of downloading an image from S3 bucket, processing the image and moving it to other S3 bucket. EC2 instance runs a scheduled task every hour to perform the operation. How should SA redesign the process so that it is highly available?
       - **Trigger a Lambda function when a new object is uploaded**

10. SA needs to design an architecture for a new, mission critical batch processing billing application. The app is required to run Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 5am to 11am. Which is the MOST cost effective EC2 pricing model?
       - **Scheduled Reserved Instances**

11. SA has a two-tier app with single EC2 instance web server and RDS MySQL Multi-AZ DB instances. The Architect is re-architecting the app for high availability by adding instances in a second AZ. Which additional services will improve the availability of the app?
    - **Auto Scaling group**
    - **ELB Classic Load Balancer**

12. SA is designing a stateful web app that will run for one year (24/7) and then be decommisioned. Load on this platform will be constant, using a number of r4.8x large instances. Key drivers for this system include HA, but elasticity is not required. What is the most cost effective way to purchase compute for this platform?
       - **Standard Reserved Instances**
Keywords: stateful web application = needs constant storage to hold different types of data including session data. Highly Available and cheapest = Standard reserved instances

13. Company is launching marketing campaign on their web tomorrow and expects a significant increase in traffic. Web is designed as multi-tiered web architecture and the increase in traffic could overwhelm current design. What should SA do to minimize effects from potential failure in one or more of tiers?
       - **Use Auto Scaling to keep up with the demand**

14. SA has multi layer app running in VPC. The app has an ELB CLB as front end in public subnet, and an EC2 based reverse proxy that performs content based routing to two backend EC2 instances hosted in private subnet. Architect sees tremendous traffic growth and is concerned that reverse proxy and current backend setup will be insufficient. Which actions should SA take to achieve cost effective sol that ensures the app automatically scales to meet traffic demand?
    - **Add Auto Scaling to the Amazon EC2 backend fleet.**
    - **Replace both the frontend and reverse proxy layers with an ELB Application Load Balancer.**
Due to the reverse proxy being a bottleneck to scalability, we need to replace it with a solution that can perform content-based routing. This means we must use an ALB not a CLB as ALBs support path-based and host-based routing Auto Scaling should be added to the architecture so that the back end EC2 instances do not become a bottleneck. With Auto Scaling instances can be added and removed from the back end fleet as demand changes A Classic Load Balancer cannot perform content-based routing so cannot be used It is unknown how the reverse proxy can be scaled with Auto Scaling however using an ALB with content-based routing is a much better design as it scales automatically and is HA by default Burstable performance instances, which are T3 and T2 instances, are designed to provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst to a higher level when required by your workload. CPU performance is not the constraint here and this would not be a cost-effective solution

15. SA is designing a photo app on AWS. Every time a user uploads a photo on S3, the architect must insert a new item to the DynamoDB table. Which AWS managed service is the BEST fit to insert the item?
    - **Lambda@Edge**

16. Company plans to use AWS for all new batch processing workloads. The companys devs use Docker containers for the new batch processing. The system design must accomodate critical and non-critical batch processing workloads 24/7. How should SA design this architecture in a cost-efficient manner?
    - **Use Amazon ECS orchestration and Auto Scaling groups: one with Reserve Instances, one with Spot Instances.**

17. Ecommerce apps are hosted on AWS. The last time a new product was launched, the app experienced a performance issue due to an enormous spike in traffic. Management decided that capacity must be doubled the week after the product is launched. Which is the MOST efficient way for management to ensure that capacity requirements are met?
    - **Add a Step Scaling policy.**

18. A call center app consists of a three-tier app using Auto scaling groups to automatically scale resources as needed. Users report that every morning at 9:00 am the system becomes very slow for about 15 mins. A SA determines that a large percentage of the call center staff starts work at 9:00 AM, so auto scaling does not have enough time to scale out to meet demand. How can the Architect fix the problem?
    - **Create an Autoscaling scheduled action to scale out the necessary resources at 8:30 AM every morning.**
