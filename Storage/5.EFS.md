## Elastic File Storage

1. EFS are as good as NFS on Linux
"migrating to AWS" and "without code changes" are the key words.
2. "Mount storage" keyword : EFS.
3. Key word : strong data consistency and file locking
4. File-locking = EFS
5. When you hear POSIX-compliant, first thought is normally AWS EFS:

Amazon EFS provides elastic, shared file storage that is POSIX-compliant. The file system you create supports concurrent read and write access from multiple Amazon EC2 instances and is accessible from all of the Availability Zones in the AWS Region where it is created.

Scenes:

1. Customer is migrating to AWS and requires applications to access Network File System shares without code changes.
 - Data is critical and accessed frequently.
 - Which storage solution should SA recommend to maximize availability and duration?
       - **Amazon EFS**

2. Design elastic application that will have between 10 to 50 EC2 concurrent instances running, dependent on load.
 - Each instance must mount storage that will read and write to the same 50GB folder.
 - What storage type will meet requirements?
       - **Amazon EFS**

3. Company is deploying a reporting application on EC2.
 - Application is expected to generate 1,000 documents every hour and each document will be 800 MB.
 - Company is concerned about strong data consistency and file locking, as various applications hosted on other EC2 instances will process report documents in parallel when they become available.
 - What storage solution will meet these requirements with LEAST amount of administrative overhead?
      - **Amazon EFS**

4. SA is designing a shared file system for a company.
 -  Multiple users will be accessing it at any given time.
 - Different teams will have their own directories, and company wants to secure files so that users can access only files owned by their team.
 - How should SA design this?
       - **Use Amazon EFS and control permissions by using file-level permissions.**

5. SA is helping customers to migrate applications to AWS.
 - The application is composed of a fleet of Linux servers that currently use shared file system to read and write data. 
 - One of the goals of moving this application to AWS is to increase the reliability of the storage tier.
 - What solution would increase reliability while minimizing the operational overhead of managing this infrastructure?
       - **Create an EFS file system and mount it to all the servers.**

6. An application runs on multiple EC2 instances.
 - Each running instance of the app must have access to a shared file system.
 - Where should the data be stored?
       - **Amazon EFS**

7. SA is developing a solution for sharing files in an organization.
 -  Solution must allow multiple users to access the storage service at once from different virtual machines and scales automatically. 
 - It must also support file-level locking.
 - Which storage service meets the requirements of this use case?
       - **Amazon EFS**

8. Media company asked SA to design a highly available storage sol to serve as a centralized document store for their EC2 instances.
 - The storage sol needs to be POSIX-compliant, scale dynamically and be able to serve up to 100 concurrent EC2 instances. 
 - Which solution meets these requirements?
       - **Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) to store and share the documents.**

## More:

1. File storage service from EC2 insatnce.
2. EFS is easy to use and provides simple interface to allow you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily.
3. With EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files.

## Tips:

1. Supports Network file system version 4 (NFS4) protocol.
2. You only pay for storage you use.
3. Can scale up to petabytes.
4. Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections.
5. Data is stored across multiple AZs within a region.
6. Read after write consistency.
