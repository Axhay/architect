## Elastic File Storage

1. EFS are as good as NFS on Linux
"migrating to AWS" and "without code changes" are the key words.
2. "Mount storage" keyword : EFS.
3. Key word : strong data consistency and file locking
4. File-locking = EFS
5. When you hear POSIX-compliant, first thought is normally AWS EFS:

Amazon EFS provides elastic, shared file storage that is POSIX-compliant. The file system you create supports concurrent read and write access from multiple Amazon EC2 instances and is accessible from all of the Availability Zones in the AWS Region where it is created.

## More:

1. File storage service from EC2 instance.
2. EFS is easy to use and provides simple interface to allow you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily.
3. With EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files.

## Tips:

1. Supports Network file system version 4 (NFS4) protocol.
2. You only pay for storage you use.
3. Can scale up to petabytes.
4. Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections.
5. Data is stored across multiple AZs within a region.
6. Read after write consistency.
