## Simple Storage Service

1. S3 can handle at least 3,500 PUT/COPY/PASTE/DELETE and 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix in a bucket.
2. S3 is storage solution.
3. Glacier is archive solution.
4. S3 is an object storage.

## S3 Pre-signed URLS:

1. Prevent unauthorized access to the reports.
2. Temporary access to protected assets.
3. Simple, occassional sharing of private files.
4. Frequent programmatic access to view or upload a file in an application.
5. Thumbnail easily created from originals if they are accidentally deleted.

## S3 standard storage:

1. Files accessed multiple times a day for first 30 days.

## S3 Standard Infrequent access:

1. Files rarely accessed in next 90 days.
2. Documents must be retreived immediately.
3. Highly available access but not frequent access.
4. Immediate access for batch jobs.
5. Media companies have more than 100TB of data to be stored and retrieved infrequently.

## Glacier storage:

1. Transition data to Glacier storage after 7 days.
2. Archived data: ex after 7 days, data can be archived.
3. Data is rarely accessed after 35 days.
4. Readily available means glacier storage.
5. Cost of Glacier is less than IA.
6. Customers can store data for as little as $1 per terabyte per month. Data stored in Glacier is immutable, meaning after an archive is created it cannot be updated.

## More:
1. Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object).
2. Great backup tool.
3. Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended.
4. Integrates with lifecycle rules.
5. Secure, durable, highly scalable object storage for devs and IT teams.
6. Safe place to store your files.
7. Object based storage.
8. Data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.
9. Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5TB.
10. There is unlimited storage.
11. Files are stored in buckets.
12. S3 is universal namespace. Name must be unique globally.
13. When you upload file to S3, you receive HTTP 200 code if upload was successful.
14. S3 is object based. Think of object as files.
15. Object consists of:
 - Key (name of object)
 - Value (this is simply data and is made up of sequence of bytes)
 - Version ID (important for versioning)
 - Metadata (Data about data you are storing)
 - Subresources (ACL, Torrents)
16. If you write a new file and read it immediately afterwards, you will be able to view that data.
17. If you update an existing file or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get older version. Basically changes to objects can take a little bit of time to propagate.
18. Charge for S3 in the following way:
Storage, requests, Data transfer, Transfer acceleration, Cross region replication pricing.
19. S3 transfer acceleration.
Uses Cloudfront edge network to accelerate your uploads to S3.
20. Instead of uploading directly to S3 bucket, you can use a distinct URL to upload directly to an edge location which will then transfer that file to S3.
21. You get a distinct URL to upload to.
22. Buckets are universal namespace.
23. Upload an object to S3 receive a HTTP 200 code.
24. Control access to buckets using either a bucket ACL or using Bucket policies.
25. S3 storage classes: S3 standard, S3-IA, S3 One Zone- IA, S3-Intelligent Tiering, S3 Glacier, S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
26. S3 standard: Designed to sustain loss of 2 facilities concurrently. AZ>=3. First byte latency is in milliseconds.
27.  S3- IA (Infrequently accessed): For data that is accessed less frequently. It needs rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retreival fee, first byte latency is in milliseconds. Retreival fee per GB retreived. Min storage duration: 30 days.
28. S3 One Zone  - IA: Lower cost option for infrequently accessed data. AZ = 1. Retreival fee : per GB retreived. Min storage duration: 30 days. 
29. S3 intelligent tiering:
Optimize cost by automatically moving data to the most cost effective access tier, without performance impact of operational overhead. AZ>=3. Min storage duration charge: 30 days.
30. S3 glacier: secure, durable, and low cost storage class for data archiving. Can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours. Min storage duration charge: 90 days. Retreival fee per GB retrieved.
31. S3 Glacier Deep Archive: S3s lowest cost storage class where retreival time of 12 hrs is acceptable. First byte latency is in select hours. Retreival fee is per GB retreived. Min storage duration charge: 180 days.

## Tips:
1. Versioning can be enabled on both source and destination buckets.
2. Regions must be unique.
3. Files in a bucket are not replicated automatically.
4. Delete markers are not replicated.
5. All newly created buckets are PRIVATE.
6. Can setup access control to your buckets using bucket policies and access control lists.
7. S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to S3 bucket.
8. Encryption in transit by SSL/TLS
9. Encryption at REST(Server side) is achieved by S3 Managed keys O SS3-S3, AWS Key management service, Managed Keys - SS3-KMS, Server side encryption with customer provided keys - SS3-C
10. Client side encryption.
