## Elastic Block Storage

1. Cold HDD (sc1):
- Throughput-oriented storage for large volumes of data that is infrequently accessed
- Scenarios where the lowest storage cost is important
- Cannot be a boot volume
2. very high sequential I/O and lowest cost
3. Provisioned IOPS. Keywords: consistent performance, database, High I/O
4. hdd : large, sequential i/o operations
ssd : small, random i/o operations
5. Because EBS is block storage while EC2 is Compute,S3 Object
6. Once you see OLTP (transaction processing DB), I/O intensive DB the most consistent EBS storage is provisioned IOPS
7. With Elastic Volumes, you can dynamically modify the size, performance, and volume type of your Amazon EBS volumes without detaching them.
Use the following process when modifying a volume:
(Optional) Before modifying a volume that contains valuable data, it is a best practice to create a snapshot of the volume in case you need to roll back your changes. For more information, see Creating Amazon EBS Snapshots.

  - How can these requirements be met without changing the application?
       - **Use encrypted EBS storage volumes with AWS-managed keys.**

9. SA is designing a DB solution that must support a high rate of random disk reads and writes.
 - It must provide consistent performance, and requires long term persistence. 
 - Which storage solution BEST meets these requirements
       - **An Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS volume**

10. SA is designing a solution for a media company that will stream large amounts of data from EC2 instance. 
 - Data streams are large and sequential, and must be able to support up to 500MB/s. 
 - Which storage type will meet performance requirements of this app?
        - **EBS Throughput Optimized HDD**

11. SA is designing an app on AWS that uses persistent block storage.

 - Which sol meets the requirement?
       - **Encrypt Amazon EBS volumes on Amazon EC2 instances.**

12. Company has a legacy app using a proprietary file system and plans to migrate the app to AWS.
 - Which storage service should the company use?
       - **Amazon EBS**

13. SA is designing a log-processing solution that requires storage that supports up to 500MB/s throughput.
 - The data is sequentially accessed by EC2 instance.
 - Which storage type satisfies these requirements?
       - **EBS Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**

14. Devs are creating a new OLTP app for a small DB that is very read-write intensive. 
 - A single table in the database is updated continuously throughout the day, and the devs want to ensure that the DB performance is consistent.
 - Which EBS storage option will achieve the MOST consistent performance to help maintain app performance?
       - **Provisioned IOPS SSD**

15. SA is designing an app that uses EBS volumes.
 - The volumes must be backed up to a different region. How should SA meet these requirements?
       - **Create EBS snapshots and then copy them to the desired region.**

16. An app requires block storage for file updates.
 - Data is 500 GB and must continuously sustain 100MB/s of aggregate read/write operations.
 - Which storage option is appropriate for this app?
       - **Amazon EBS**

17. SA must review an application deployed on EC2 instances that currently stores multiple 5-GB files on attached instance store volumes.
 - The company recently experienced a significant data loss after stopping and starting their instances and wants to prevent the data loss from happening again.
 - Sol should minimize performance impact and the number of code changes required.

       - **Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) storage**

20. SA is designing the storage layer for a production relational DB.
