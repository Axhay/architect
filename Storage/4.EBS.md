## Elastic Block Storage

1. Cold HDD (sc1):
- Throughput-oriented storage for large volumes of data that is infrequently accessed
- Scenarios where the lowest storage cost is important
- Cannot be a boot volume
2. very high sequential I/O and lowest cost
3. Provisioned IOPS. Keywords: consistent performance, database, High I/O
4. hdd : large, sequential i/o operations
ssd : small, random i/o operations
5. Because EBS is block storage while EC2 is Compute,S3 Object
6. Once you see OLTP (transaction processing DB), I/O intensive DB the most consistent EBS storage is provisioned IOPS
7. With Elastic Volumes, you can dynamically modify the size, performance, and volume type of your Amazon EBS volumes without detaching them.
Use the following process when modifying a volume:
(Optional) Before modifying a volume that contains valuable data, it is a best practice to create a snapshot of the volume in case you need to roll back your changes. For more information, see Creating Amazon EBS Snapshots.
