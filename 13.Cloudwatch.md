## Cloudwatch

1. Must include a two minute warning.

2. Memory -> only custom cloudwatch.

3. Cloudtrail logs Api calls.

4. You can configure Amazon CloudWatch Events to invoke a Lambda action in response to suspicious or unexpected behavior in your AWS environment detected by Amazon GuardDuty.

5. The unified CloudWatch agent enables you to do the following:
Collect more system-level metrics from Amazon EC2 instances across operating systems. The metrics can include in-guest metrics, in addition to the metrics for EC2 instances. The additional metrics that can be collected are listed in Metrics Collected by the CloudWatch Agent.

Collect system-level metrics from on-premises servers. These can include servers in a hybrid environment as well as servers not managed by AWS.
✑ Retrieve custom metrics from your applications or services using the StatsD and collectd protocols. StatsD is supported on both Linux servers and servers running Windows Server. collectd is supported only on Linux servers.
✑ Collect logs from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers, running either Linux or Windows Server.
You can store and view the metrics that you collect with the CloudWatch agent in CloudWatch just as you can with any other CloudWatch metrics. The default namespace for metrics collected by the CloudWatch agent is CWAgent, although you can specify a different namespace when you configure the agent.

6. There are 2 main types of monitoring you can do on AWS EC2 Instances as follows
✑ Basic Monitoring for Amazon EC2 instances: Seven pre-selected metrics at five-minute frequency and three status check metrics at one-minute frequency, for no additional charge.
✑ Detailed Monitoring for Amazon EC2 instances: All metrics available to Basic Monitoring at one-minute frequency, for an additional charge. Instances with
Detailed Monitoring enabled allows data aggregation by Amazon EC2 AMI ID and instance type.


Scenes:

1. Ecommerce application places orders in SQS queue.
  - When a message is received, EC2 worker instances process the request.
  - EC2 instances are in Auto Scaling group.
  - How should architecture be designed to scale up and down with LEAST amount of operational overhead?
       - **Use an Amazon Cloudwatch alarm based on the number of visible messages to scale the Auto Scaling group up or down.**

2. SA needs to configure scaling policied based on Cloudwatch metrics for an Auto scaling group.
  - The application running on the instances is memory intensive.
  - How can Architect meet this requirement?
       - **Publish custom metrics to CloudWatch from the application.**

3. SA is designing a solution to send CloudWatch Alarm notifications to a group of users on a smartphone mobile application.
  - What are key steps to this solution?
        - **Configure cloudwatch alarm to send the notification to an Amazon SNS topic whenever there is an alarm.**
        - **Create the platform endpoints for mobile devices and subscribe the SNS topic with platform endpoints.**

4. Web App runs on 10 EC2 instances launched from single customer Amazon Machine Language (AMI).
  - EC2 instances are behind an Interet application load balancer.
  - Amazon Route 53 provides DNS for the app.
  - How should a SA automate recovery when a web server instance stops replying to requests?
       - **Add cloudwatch alarm actions for each instance to restart if the Status check(Any) fails.**

5. SA must migrate monolithic onpremises application to AWS.
  - It is a web app with a load balancer, web server, application server, and relational database.
  - Key requirement driving the migration is that app should perform better and be more elastic.
  - Which of the architecture would meet these requirements?
       - **Replatform the application as three tier application. Use Elastic load balancing for incoming requests. Use EC2 for web and application tiers. Use CloudWatch alarms and Auto Scaling for horizontal scaling at the web tier.**

6. App runs on EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group.
  - When instances are terminated, the Systems operations team cannot determine the root cause, because the logs on the terminated instances are lost.
  - How can root cause be determined?
       - **Use Amazon Cloudwatch agent to push the logs to Amazon Cloudwatch logs.**

7. Org has long running image processing app that runs on Spot instances that will be terminated when interrupted. 
  - A highly available workload must be designed to respond to Spot Instance interruption notices. 
  - The solution must include a two minute warning when there is not enough capacity.
  - How can these requirements be met?
       - **Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to invoke an AWS Lambda function that can launch On-Demand Instances.**

8. SA is designing a solution that can monitor memory and disk space utilization of all EC2 instances running Amazon Linux and Windows.
  - Which solution meets this requirement?
        - **Custom Amazon CloudWatch metrics**

9. SA notices slower response times from an application.
  - CloudWatch metrics on the MySQL RDS indicate Read IOPS are high and fluctuate significantly when the database is under load.
  - How should the DB environment be re-designed to resolve the IOPS fluctuation?
       - **Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS.**

10. SA is designing sol that includes a managed VPN connection.
  - To monitor whether the VPN connection is up or down, architect should use:
       - **the CloudWatch TunnelState Metric.**

11. Company wants to use Amazon GuardDuty to detect malicious and unexpected activity.
  - They want to use CloudWatch to ensure that when findings occur, remediation occurs automatically.
  - Which cloudwatch feature you use to trigger AWS Lambda function to perform remediation?
       - **Events**

12. Design a new web app on Amazon EC2. 
  - System must make application specific metrics, such as application security events, available to the sysops team.
  - How do SA enable this in the design?
       - **Install the Amazon CloudWatch Logs agent on the application instances. Design the application to store events in application log files.**

13. Application calls service run by vendor. Vendor charges on the number of calls. Finance department needs to know number of calls that are made to the service to validate the billing statements.
  - How can SA design a system to durably store number of calls without requiring changes to the application?
       - **Publish a custom Amazon CloudWatch metric that counts calls to the service.**

14. S3 data stored with encryption at rest:
  - Implementing data lake solution on S3
  - Data lake has two types of encryption:  Server side and Client side
  - Data stored in S3 must be encrypted at rest. Which option can achieve this?
        - **Use S3 server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C).**
        - **Use client-side encryption before ingesting the data to Amazon S3 using encryption keys.**

15. Encrypt data in S3.
  -  Encryption keys generated and managed on-premises. How can SA meet security requirements?
        - **SSE-C: Server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys**
